# Tech Company Salary-based Analysis Project
This project aims to explore the reasons influencing salaries within the tech industry. By analyzing a dataset from an anonymous tech company, I delved into the correlations and patterns between salary levels and various factors.  

## Background
During my exchange program in Germany, I acquired proficiency in the R programming language through Biostatistics course. Inspired by a podcast's discussion on gender-salary dynamics and driven by my aspiration to work in the tech industry, I embarked on this project.
