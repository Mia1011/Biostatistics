# Tech Company Salary-based Analysis Project

## About
Inspired by a recent podcast about the gender-salary relationship, I would like to delve deeper into the relationship between salary and different factors. In this project, my focus is to uncover and interpret patterns in the data in order to understand the reasons influencing salary levels. I will be analyzing a salary based dataset from Kaggle, originating from an anonymous tech company. (Unfortunately, I can’t attach the link here because the original source website seems to be no longer available…)
