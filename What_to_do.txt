What do we need to report?
1. Summary statistics (means, SDs, N) per cell //ok
2. F(df1, df2) = F-value, p = p-value, effect size per effect (apa package!)
3. Possibly pairwise contrasts (or t-tests) //ok
4. Interpretation (direction of effect and theoretical meaning)

Problem shooting:
* dplyr::
* data <- data....
